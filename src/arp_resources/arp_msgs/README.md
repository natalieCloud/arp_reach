# arp_msgs README

This package contains a subset of messages that will be used in the repos [PCD_PROCESSING](https://github.com/natalieCloud/arp_reach/tree/main/src/arp_resources/arp_reach/pcd_processing),
[Reach_Config](https://github.com/natalieCloud/arp_reach/tree/main/src/arp_resources/arp_reach/reach_config),
and [XML_PROCESSING](https://github.com/natalieCloud/arp_reach/tree/main/src/arp_resources/arp_reach/xml_processing)

They will be merged into the arg_msgs at [augmented_reality_painting](https://github.com/OSU-AIMS/augmented-reality-painting)
